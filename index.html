            <h2>Why Braga?</h2>
            <h3>Braga, the heart of Portugal</h3>
            <p>
              The legend has it that Braga, one of the oldest cities in Portugal, was originally known as Bracara Augusta by the Romans. Unlike Rome, Braga's beginnings were rooted in the heart of the Minho region, known for its lush landscapes and rich history. As early as the 3rd century BC, Braga emerged as a significant cultural and religious hub in the Iberian Peninsula, often referred to as the "Portuguese Rome" due to its numerous churches and religious architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can still see traces of ancient Braga today. Beyond the modern shopping streets, tranquil squares with inviting cafes, and renowned restaurants offering delectable regional cuisine, you can explore the historic city center and discover its ancient Roman ruins, medieval churches, and beautiful gardens. From the striking Sé Cathedral to the lush Bom Jesus do Monte sanctuary, Braga offers a captivating blend of history and modernity, all set against the picturesque backdrop of rolling hills and the serene beauty of the Minho region.
